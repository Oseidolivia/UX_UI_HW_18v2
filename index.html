        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
        <p>To get into the mindset of the intended user, I perform qualitative interviews to gain understanding of the user’s pain points, wants, and needs. This personalized method helps me to create a user persona, setting up any project for success, therefore producing a delightful user experience.

                <h3>User Research</h3>
                <p>In addition to user interviews, I perform usability testing throughout the project to make sure it’s on track. An intuitive and seamless user experience is the end goal, so continuing to research and conduct usability tests throughout the process is a must.

                            <p>To further solidify the user’s wants and needs, I create an Empathy Map based on my research and usability tests. From here, I gain a better understanding of the user and can create a tailored, delightful experience for them.
